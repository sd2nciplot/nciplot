# NCI Plot TACC App

This app converts pdb files into a csv dataframe.

The app takes a directory of pdb files as inputs and an output file
name as a parameter. The pdb files will be processed and output into a
csv file with the given name. The csv file will be placed in the data
folder with the pdb files.
